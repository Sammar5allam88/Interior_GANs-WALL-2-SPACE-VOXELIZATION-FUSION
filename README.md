# Interior_GANs-WALL-2-SPACE-VOXELIZATION-FUSION

This research project addresses the problem of interior spaces design (ISD) as it demonstrates a lot of variation and styles that are widely expanding recently with multiple designers tending to get their own distinguished signatures. Moreover, ISD is time-consuming, multi-step / multi-layer through a continuous iterative process to finding alternatives. Recently, computational design elaboration on ISD is manifested only through benches and shelves. However, the whole space is evolved to be a fusion with a cloud of voxels that respond to use patterns of special needs like the ones of disabled. Space voxelization is aimed to be interactive to sensors reading as well. This approach can generate more ISD to accommodate disabled usability. Inference Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (iWGAN) is adopted to apply generative ISD, hence extending the boundaries of space furnishing to space articulation as behave as one. Three iterations with three different samples and hyperparameters are used to improve results. As iWGAN is trained more to learn both an encoder and a decoder simultaneously. This approach is adequate to train 3D datasets and learn in a 3-dimensional space. Results have delineated progress after 19,801 to resemble the trained data with almost 82% accuracy.
